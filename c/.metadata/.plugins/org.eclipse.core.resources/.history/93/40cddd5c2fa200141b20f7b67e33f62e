/*socket(domain, type, protocol)
 * domain, or address family —
    communication domain in which the socket should be created. Some of address families are AF_INET (IP), AF_INET6 (IPv6), AF_UNIX (local channel, similar to pipes), AF_ISO (ISO protocols), and AF_NS (Xerox Network Systems protocols).
type —
    type of service. This is selected according to the properties required by the application: SOCK_STREAM (virtual circuit service), SOCK_DGRAM (datagram service), SOCK_RAW (direct IP service). Check with your address family to see whether a particular service is available.
protocol —
    indicate a specific protocol to use in supporting the sockets operation. This is useful in cases where some families may have more than one protocol to support a given type of service. The return value is a file descriptor (a small integer). The analogy of creating a socket is that of requesting a telephone line from the phone company. */
